//! The `nullhawk` command-line interface.
//!
//! The CLI and the desktop application share one engine. There is no second scanner,
//! no second proxy and no CLI-only code path that behaves differently from the GUI —

//!
//! Commands that are not implemented are not registered at all, rather than
//! registered as stubs that fail at runtime: `nullhawk --help` lists what genuinely
//! works today and nothing else.
