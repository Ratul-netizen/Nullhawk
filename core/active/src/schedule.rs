//! The queue: what would be sent, and then the sending.
//!
//! Two functions, and the split between them is the safety property. [`Plan::prepare`]
//! is synchronous, takes no `async`, and answers every question a tester has before
//! authorizing traffic. [`run`] is the only thing that sends.
//!
//! # One queue per host
//!
//! ```text
//! prepare()  ──▶  host A: 3 experiments  ──┐
//!                 host B: 1 experiment   ──┤── hosts_at_once slots
//!                 host C: 2 experiments  ──┘
//!
//! run()      ──▶  within a host: strictly sequential, with a pause between
//! ```
//!
//! Concurrency without spawning: the host queues are futures driven together on one
//! task by [`futures::stream::buffer_unordered`]. That is what lets the scheduler hold
//! a `&dyn Lab` across the whole run instead of requiring every caller to hand it an
//! `Arc`, and it is why stopping needs no cross-thread handshake — the flag is read
//! between awaits on the same task.
//!
//! # Nothing is retried
//!
//! A transport error produces [`Verification::Inconclusive`] and the experiment is
//! over. Retrying would double the traffic a budget accounted for, and a host that
//! just refused a connection is the last host that should be asked again immediately.
