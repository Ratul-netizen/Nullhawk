//! Everything an active run could settle, from one place.
//!
//! Two sources, and they are genuinely different:
//!
//! ```text
//! a passive check saw something   →  "this host may reflect any Origin"
//!                                     a suspicion about the application
//!
//! a request has an input          →  "this endpoint takes `q`"
//!                                     a work item; nothing is suspected yet
//! ```
//!
//! The second kind does not belong in a passive pass. `nullhawk scan passive` reports
//! what the checks *saw*, and an endpoint having a query parameter is not something
//! anybody saw — it is a list of places nobody has looked. Putting five hundred of
//! those into a passive summary would bury the two lines that came from evidence.
//!
//! So they are enumerated here, at the moment an active run is being planned, which is
//! the only moment they mean anything. The plan then shows the total and its request
//! ceiling before a single request goes out.
//!
//! # One function, two front ends
//!
//! The CLI and the window both call [`standing`]. They used to each have their own,
//! which is how two surfaces of one tool come to disagree about what is testable.
