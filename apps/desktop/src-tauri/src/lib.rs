//! The Nullhawk desktop shell.
//!
//! The shell is deliberately thin. All application state — projects, traffic, scan
//! jobs — lives in the Rust core, and the React frontend is a view over it. Putting
//! state in the frontend would mean the CLI and the desktop client could disagree
//! about what a project contains, and it would put security-relevant logic in the
//! most easily influenced part of the process.
//!
//! So the only thing crossing the IPC boundary is a versioned command surface:
//!
//! ```text
//! React ──invoke()──→ Tauri IPC ──→ commands ──→ nullhawk-engine / nullhawk-storage
//! ```
//!
//! Commands are added only as the milestone that implements them lands, so the
//! surface never advertises capability that does not exist. At M12.4 it covers
//! projects, the proxy, history, the repeater, the certificate authority, project
//! scope, identities, declared objects, the authorization matrix with
//! constructed attempts, findings and the report — everything
//! the CLI can do, calling exactly the same crates.
//!
//! # State lives in Rust
//!
//! [`state::AppState`] holds the open project and the running proxy. The frontend
//! holds only what it is currently rendering, and re-asks after anything that could
//! change the answer.
