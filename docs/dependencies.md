# Dependency policy

Nullhawk is a security tool. Its own supply chain is part of its threat surface, so
dependencies get more scrutiny here than in an ordinary application.

## Rules

1. **Add a dependency because it is needed now**, not because it might be useful later.
   The workspace manifest lists only crates that something currently compiles against.
2. **Prefer the boring, widely-audited crate** over the clever one, especially for
   parsing and cryptography.
3. **Never hand-roll cryptography.** If a task needs crypto and no obvious well-reviewed
   crate exists, that is a signal to change the design, not to write it.
4. **Version bumps need a reason.** "Upgrading for the sake of upgrading" churns the
   lockfile and hides the changes that matter.
5. **`Cargo.lock` is committed.** This is a workspace producing applications, so
   reproducible builds matter more than testing against the newest resolvable graph.

## Audit

CI runs `cargo audit` on every push and pull request.

- **Security advisories fail the build.** They are not negotiable and are not ignored
  to get CI green.
- **Unmaintained-crate warnings do not fail the build.** They almost always arrive
  through a transitive dependency nobody in this repository controls, and a job that is
  permanently red is a job nobody reads. They are still reported, and anything reaching
  code that touches network input or credentials gets treated as a real finding.

## Accepted advisories

Any advisory deliberately accepted must be recorded here, with:

- the advisory ID and a link,
- the dependency and **the path by which it enters the graph** (`cargo tree -i <crate>`),
- what functionality is affected, and whether Nullhawk reaches the vulnerable code,
- the mitigation, if any,
- why it cannot currently be fixed,
- what would let it be removed.

An empty section below means the audit is genuinely clean, not that nobody looked.

### Currently accepted

**RUSTSEC-2024-0429** — unsoundness in `glib`'s `Iterator` and `DoubleEndedIterator`
impls for `VariantStrIter` ([advisory](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0429)).

- **Path in:** `glib 0.18.5` ← `gtk` / `gdk` / `webkit2gtk` ← `tauri`. Linux desktop
  only; the Windows and macOS builds do not link it.
- **Reached?** No. The unsound code is `glib::VariantStrIter`, part of GVariant
  handling inside the GTK stack. Nullhawk calls no `glib` API directly, and nothing in
  the engine, proxy or storage path passes through it. No network input or credential
  ever reaches it.
- **Mitigation:** none needed beyond not calling it.
- **Why not fixed:** the version is pinned by `tauri` 2.x's GTK bindings, not by this
  workspace. Forcing a newer `glib` would break the binding crates that expect 0.18.
- **Removed when:** Tauri's Linux stack moves to `glib` 0.20 or later, or the desktop
  client stops using WebKitGTK.

Seven further crates are flagged **unmaintained** — `proc-macro-error`,
`rustls-pemfile`, and the five `unic-*` crates — all through Tauri's build-time and ICU
dependencies. Per the policy above these are reported rather than accepted: none of
them is a security advisory, and none sits on a path that handles network input or
credentials.

## Secret scanning

CI runs `gitleaks` over the **full history**, not just the tip — a credential deleted
from the current tree is still a credential.

Do not add broad ignore rules to make a finding go away. If a scanner flags test data,
the fix is to make the test data unmistakably fake (see the `TEST_USER` /
`TEST_PASSWORD_NOT_A_SECRET` fixtures in `core/types/src/identity.rs`), not to teach the
scanner to stay quiet.

This applies to plausible-looking values from public specifications too. RFC 7617's
worked Basic-auth example is a real, decodable credential string as far as a scanner is
concerned, and there is no way for a reviewer scrolling a diff to tell it apart from a
live one at a glance. Assert on the decoded value instead of embedding the encoded
literal.

## Notable dependencies

| Crate | Why it is here | Notes |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- |
| `rusqlite` (bundled) | Project metadata store | `bundled` compiles SQLite from source, so behaviour does not vary with whatever SQLite the host happens to ship |
| `r2d2` / `r2d2_sqlite` | Connection pooling | The proxy writes while the UI reads |
| `sha2` | Content addressing for the blob store | Not used for anything security-critical; it is a dedup and integrity key |
| `tauri` | Desktop shell | Drags in the largest part of the dependency graph and sets the MSRV floor |
| `clap` | CLI | |
| `tracing` | Structured logging | Secrets never reach it — see `docs/security-invariants.md`, invariant 2 |

## MSRV

`rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` is the **minimum** supported compiler.
`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the **exact** compiler used for development and CI. They are
different values on purpose; see `docs/development.md`.

The MSRV is currently `1.88`, which is imposed by the dependency graph rather than
chosen: `plist`, `serde_with`, `time`, `darling` and the ICU crates all require it, and
they arrive via Tauri and `url`. Do not raise the MSRV to match whatever compiler is
installed locally.

## Accepted advisories

`cargo deny check advisories` (and `cargo-audit`) gate the RustSec database. The IDs below are
**accepted** in `deny.toml`'s `[advisories] ignore` list: each is an *unmaintained* transitive
dependency — an informational advisory, not a vulnerability — that Nullhawk cannot remove without
an upstream change. They are listed one by one (rather than downgrading the whole `unmaintained`
lint) so a newly-unmaintained crate still fails CI and forces a deliberate decision. Re-review
when Tauri and the rustls stack update.

| Advisory | Crate | Why it is accepted |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0370 | `proc-macro-error` | Unmaintained; arrives via Tauri's proc-macro dependencies. No direct use. |
| RUSTSEC-2025-0075 / 0080 / 0081 / 0098 / 0100 | `unic-*` (ICU) | Unmaintained; the ICU/`unic-*` stack arrives via Tauri and `url`. No direct use. |
| RUSTSEC-2025-0134 | `rustls-pemfile` | Unmaintained, superseded by `rustls-pki-types`; still pulled by the rustls stack. Migrate when the ecosystem does. |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0436 | `paste` | Unmaintained; a compile-time macro pulled in by `wasmi`, the extension WASM interpreter. No runtime code, no direct use. Re-review when `wasmi` drops it. |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0449 | `unsafe-libyaml` | Unmaintained; the YAML parser under `serde_yaml_ng` (itself the maintained `serde_yaml` fork). No maintained pure-Rust YAML stack avoids it today. Re-review when the ecosystem moves off it. |
