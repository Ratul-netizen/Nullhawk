//! `input.ssrf` — whether an input makes the server fetch a URL of the caller's choosing.
//!
//! The high-confidence, no-collaborator half of SSRF detection: point the input at a
//! resource only the server can reach — the cloud instance metadata service at
//! `169.254.169.254`, off-limits from the internet — and see its contents come back.
//!
//! ```text
//! url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/   → ami-id  instance-id  iam/  …
//! url=<original>                                  → the ordinary page, no metadata.
//! ```
//!
//! The metadata index is a list of tokens (`ami-id`, `instance-id`,
//! `block-device-mapping/`, `security-credentials`) that a normal application response
//! has no reason to contain, so their appearance *from a request the caller aimed at an
//! internal address* is the proof. A control request to a benign external URL that does
//! not return them rules out a page that happened to mention one.
//!
//! It only reads, and only the metadata index — not the credential path beneath it. A
//! confirmed hit means the credential path is reachable; retrieving it is the tester's
//! call, not an automated scan's.
//!
//! # Blind SSRF, when a collaborator is configured
//!
//! Where the metadata trick reflects nothing, a *blind* fetch — one that makes the
//! request but reveals nothing in the response — is still caught if the run was given an
//! out-of-band collaborator ([`Lab::canary`]). The input is set to a collaborator URL
//! carrying an unguessable token; a callback bearing that token is proof the server made
//! the request, whatever its response said. Without a collaborator this case is honestly
//! reported as refuted rather than silently skipped.
