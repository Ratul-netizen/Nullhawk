//! Reading what a credential says about itself — when it dies, and whose it is.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A run against a real target replayed twenty requests as a declared identity and got
//! twenty `401`s. Every one was doomed before it left: the token had expired
//! eighty-five minutes earlier, and the token **said so** — `exp` is an unencrypted
//! field in the middle of every JWT, sitting in the project the whole time.
//!
//! Twenty requests at somebody's production API to learn something that was written
//! down. That is the cost, and it is charged to the target rather than to us. The
//! result was worse than nothing: a run that reported "tested 20" and established
//! nothing, which reads like coverage.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! Decide that a credential is *valid*. An unexpired token can be revoked, scoped
//! elsewhere, or simply wrong, and only the application knows. This answers the one
//! question that can be answered without asking: **has the credential's own stated
//! lifetime already ended?** A `None` means "nothing here says otherwise", never "this
//! will work".
//!
//! Nothing is decrypted and no signature is checked. The payload of a JWT is base64url,
//! not ciphertext — reading it is not an attack on anything, and the value read is a
//! timestamp rather than anything worth protecting.
