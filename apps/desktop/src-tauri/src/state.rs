//! What the desktop client is holding open.
//!
//! All application state lives here rather than in the frontend. A React store that
//! believed a different thing about a project than the engine did would eventually
//! show a request that was never sent, and a security tool that displays the wrong
//! request is worse than one that shows nothing.
//!
//! # The proxy is a task, not an object
//!
//! [`nullhawk_proxy::ProxyServer::serve`] consumes the server and loops until the
//! process ends, which is right for a CLI and wrong for a window with a stop button.
//! So the server is moved into a task and [`RunningProxy`] holds the handle; stopping
//! aborts the task, which drops the listener and closes the port.
//!
//! In-flight connections are dropped when that happens. That is the intended
//! behaviour: "stop" from a UI means stop now, and a browser retrying a request it
//! just lost is a better outcome than a stop button that appears not to work.
