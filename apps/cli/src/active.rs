//! `nullhawk scan active` — the experiments a passive pass could not run.
//!
//! The first command in Nullhawk that sends traffic nobody typed, so it is the first one
//! that asks before doing it.
//!
//! ```text
//! nullhawk scan passive  reads a project                    → hypotheses, filed as nothing
//! nullhawk scan active   settles them, one request at a time → findings, or refutations
//! ```
//!
//! # The order of operations, and why it is this order
//!
//! 1. Read the hypotheses the last passive pass raised. If there are none, stop and
//!    say so — there is nothing an active run can invent for itself.
//! 2. Build a [`Plan`], which sends nothing.
//! 3. Print it: which hosts, how many requests at most, what was skipped and why.
//! 4. Ask, unless `--yes`. A non-interactive stdin answers *no*.
//! 5. Run.
//!
//! `--dry-run` stops after step 3. It is not a flag the sending path honours — the
//! sending path is simply not called, which is the same discipline as
//! [`nullhawk_scan::passive::scan`] having no transport in its signature.
//!
//! # A refutation is a result
//!
//! The output leads with what was settled, in both directions. "This host does not
//! reflect arbitrary origins" is the sentence that stops a passive suspicion from
//! following a tester around for the rest of an engagement, and it is printed as
//! prominently as a finding.
