//! Where a value sits in a request, and how to put a different one there.
//!
//! Two subsystems need this and neither owns it. M12.5 builds the request nobody
//! captured by replacing a declared object identifier; M13.4 places a marker in an
//! input to see where it comes back. Both are asking the same two questions about an
//! [`ObjectLocation`], so the answers live here rather than in whichever crate needed
//! them first.
//!
//! ```text
//! locate(request, "acct-1000")  ->  [PathSegment { index: 2 }, Query { name: "ref" }]
//! value_at(request, location)   ->  "acct-1000"
//! substitute(request, location, "acct-2000")
//! ```
//!
//! # Nothing else about the request changes
//!
//! A substitution touches exactly the bytes at the location it was given. Header order,
//! casing, duplicates and the body all survive, because a generated request that
//! quietly differed from its original in a second place would make every conclusion
//! drawn from it unfalsifiable.
//!
//! # Sensitive headers are never a location
//!
//! [`locate`] skips them without exception. An `Authorization` value is a credential,
//! not an input: rewriting one changes *who is asking* in the middle of a test about
//! what they may ask for, and no caller has a legitimate reason to want that.
//!
//! # One way to substitute, and it always validates
//!
//! [`substitute`] refuses a replacement containing control characters, whatever the
//! caller is. A value carrying CR or LF would split the request it is spliced into,
//! and that is true of a marker a check generated exactly as much as of a value a
//! person typed — so there is no unvalidated variant to reach for. A future check that
//! genuinely needs to place a CR has to add that path deliberately, and say why.
