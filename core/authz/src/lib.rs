//! # nullhawk-authz
//!
//! Authorization testing: take one request that worked, replay it as everybody else,
//! and say what that proves.
//!
//! This is the highest-value manual work in most engagements and the part testers
//! most often run out of time for. Doing it by hand means keeping several sessions
//! alive, resending the same request in each, and eyeballing responses that differ in
//! a dozen irrelevant ways — for every interesting endpoint, every time something
//! changes.
//!
//! ## The shape of a run
//!
//! ```text
//! base request ──┬── replayed as the owner    → the baseline (fresh, not the capture)
//!                ├── replayed as User B       → compare
//!                ├── replayed as Admin        → compare
//!                └── replayed as Anonymous    → the control
//! ```
//!
//! Three decisions in that diagram are the whole design:
//!
//! **The baseline is replayed, never reused.** The captured response is minutes or
//! weeks old; the session that produced it may have expired, the record may have been
//! deleted, the feature flag may have flipped. Comparing a fresh response against a
//! stale one produces differences that belong to time, not to authorization.
//!
//! **Anonymous is a control, not just another row.** If an unauthenticated request
//! gets the same document, then "User B can read it" proves nothing about User B —
//! the resource is public. A matrix that reported six violations for a public page
//! would be worse than useless, so the control demotes them and the run reports the
//! one thing that is actually true. See [`Matrix::appears_public`].
//!
//! **Every send is recorded, as its identity.** A result that exists only in a
//! terminal cannot be cited in a report. Each replay is stored with `origin = authz`
//! and the identity it was sent as, so the evidence behind a finding is two request
//! ids somebody else can open months later.
//!
//! ## Constructing, not only replaying
//!
//! A replay answers "can User B reach this URL?". It cannot answer "can User B reach
//! **User A's** invoice?" when the only captured traffic is User B asking for their
//! own — the request that would answer it has never existed. [`construct`] builds it,
//! by substituting an identifier the tester has declared as somebody else's. Nothing
//! about which value is an object, or whose it is, is guessed. See that module.
//!
//! ## Suggesting, never assuming
//!
//! Declaring every object identifier by hand is what keeps constructed testing
//! narrower than it should be. [`suggest`] reads captured traffic and offers the
//! values that *vary where an identifier would* — and stops there. A suggestion is not
//! an object and an object is not an ownership claim; both remaining steps are a
//! person's. Nothing in that module sends a request or writes a finding.
//!
//! ## What a run does not do
//!
//! It does not decide that anything is a vulnerability on its own. It produces
//! outcomes and, from them, candidate findings capped at what the evidence supports —
//! [`Confidence::Tentative`] for a similarity match, [`Confidence::Firm`] when an
//! object the tester declared as somebody else's turns up in the response body, and
//! [`Confidence::Confirmed`] only when a second replay reproduced the same result.
//! See [`analysis`].
//!
//! There is a second route to [`Confidence::Firm`], added in M12.10 and needing no
//! declaration: two identities served not a document of the same *shape* but the same
//! *document*, field for field, behind an unauthenticated request that was refused it.
//! The anonymous control is the gate — two identities reading an identical public page
//! looks exactly the same from inside a comparison — and
//! [`AnonymousControl::NotTried`] does not clear it, because a run that did not look
//! has not shown anything. See [`compare::Baseline`] and
//! [`nullhawk_types::structure`].
//!
//! ## Requests that change things
//!
//! A matrix replays whatever it is given. Pointing one at `DELETE /accounts/42` will
//! delete account 42 up to six times. The engine will not stop you — a security tool
//! that quietly refused to test destructive endpoints would be hiding the most
//! serious authorization bugs there are — but [`Plan::is_state_changing`] flags it so
//! a caller can ask first, and the CLI does.
